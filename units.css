/* %, vw, vh  */

/* % is used for the determenation of the width and height of any part relative(with respect to) parent  */

/* vw(view width): It is the unit that is an absolute unit and it takes the width respect to the width of the device screen, irrespective of its parent. For example :
    If we give the width of the main(i.e parent) as 50 vw, it takes the size exact half of the screen size.
    
    Similarly, if the width of the section(i.e child of the main) is 75vw, it takes the size 75 of the whole screen size unlike the % which is relative*/

main {
  border: 4px solid black;

section {
  border: 3px solid lightgreen;
