    // Http is itself a stateless protocol as it can't keep the track of user's state
// cookies are stored in user's computer 
// For the session tracking, we need to use the server side scripting like php , asp, node, django 
// whenever the session is tracked, unique id(uid) is generated and assigned to the user 
    
    // To start the session we use the session_start() method inside of the php tag
// demo 1 contains the main code and all of the remaining files are the tester files 
    


    /*Session Id*/
    // Session default saving duration 
// print_r method 
// session_unset(): to remove all of the session variables at once and the data can be again setup 
// session_destroy(): it is like stopping the session and after destroying the info can't be retaken
